Place your production logo image in this folder as `logo.png` so it can be served by Vite at `/logo.png`.

Recommended specs:
- Format: PNG (or SVG for vector)
- Size: 512x512 or wider; you can also provide a smaller 192x192 for faster loading
- Filenames: `logo.png` (exact)

After adding the file, reload the dev server (Vite) or refresh the browser to see the logo in the header.
